## ðŸ“Œ&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction

This a quickly produced example NN designed to predict event lineups given the event titles. 

**Using the lightning-hydra-template:** This example was built using the [lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template) developed by [ashleve](https://github.com/ashleve). This is a template that I prefer for quickly setting up prototype ML projects. While it is effective for quickly developing prototype ML projects it's not intended for production/deployment environment. I've kept useful parts of the original readme. 


### Why Hydra?

[Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the development of research and other complex applications. The key feature is the ability to dynamically create a hierarchical configuration by composition and override it through config files and the command line. It allows you to conveniently manage experiments and provides many useful plugins, like [Optuna Sweeper](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/plugins/optuna_sweeper) for hyperparameter search, or [Ray Launcher](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/plugins/ray_launcher) for running jobs on a cluster.

### Logs

**Hydra creates new working directory for every executed run.** By default, logs have the following structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ logs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ experiments                     # Folder for the logs generated by experiments
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ runs                          # Folder for single runs
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ experiment_name             # Experiment name

â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚
